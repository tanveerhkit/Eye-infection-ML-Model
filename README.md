### Overview

Eye infections are a common problem worldwide, and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This ML model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze eye images and classify them into categories such as infected and non-infected. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of eye images curated from various sources, enabling it to generalize well to unseen data.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of thousands of labeled eye images, with annotations indicating the presence or absence of infection. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model performance. Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. However, instructions for obtaining a similar dataset or using transfer learning with pre-trained models are provided in the documentation.

### Model Architecture

The ML model is built using the PyTorch deep learning framework. It employs a CNN architecture, specifically tailored for image classification tasks. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers, culminating in a softmax output layer for multi-class classification. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum and cross-entropy loss.

### Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Train the model using the provided training script.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation and test sets.
5. Deploy the trained model for inference in your application.

Detailed instructions for training, evaluation, and deployment are provided in the documentation.

### Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to assess the model's classification performance across different classes. The evaluation results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately classify eye images and detect infections with high precision and recall.

### Deployment

The trained model can be deployed in various environments, including web applications, mobile apps, and edge devices. Deployment options include containerization using Docker, integration with cloud services like AWS or Azure, and deployment frameworks such as TensorFlow Serving or FastAPI. Detailed instructions and examples for deployment are provided in the documentation.
